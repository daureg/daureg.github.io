		<h1>Rise of the deads</h1>
		<p>Every year it's the same: excitation builds up through October
			until the last night when everyone can talk once again with their
			deceased relatives. Some are frustrated by that brevity but the
			majority understands that such an extraordinary technology of
			mind-machine transfer is very expensive and that the government
			cannot afford to use it more often. I always like this
			explanation; it is much more satisfactory than the sad reality:
			despite the large breadth of data we gathered about all the
			citizens during a century, our simulations cannot maintain
			plausibility for more than a few hours.</p>
